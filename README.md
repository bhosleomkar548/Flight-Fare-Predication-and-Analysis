# Flight-Fare-Predication-and-Analysis

## • Developed a flight price prediction model using Random Forest Regressor, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Tree Regressor, achieving a high R² score of 96.08% after performing hyperparameter tuning.  
## • Streamlined data preprocessing by implementing automated scripts for data cleaning and encoding, increasing data processing capacity by 200% while maintaining high accuracy.  
## • Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to explore relationships between features and flight prices, utilizing Seaborn for visualizing correlations and trends in the data.  
## • Conducted systematic adjustments in hyperparameters using RandomizedSearchCV on the Random Forest algorithm; achieved a reduction of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 15 units while improving model reliability in predictions across datasets.
